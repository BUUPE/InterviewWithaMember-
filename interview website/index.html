        <p>
            I joined UPE because I had multiple friends that were in computer science that were in UPE and most of them were really smart and really passionate about the subject. I figured that if they were passionate and in UPE, then it was probably a good place for me to be if I was as passionate as they were. I definitely made the right decision.

    <div class = "interviewquestions">
    <h5>What have you gained through UPE?</h5>
    </div>
    
    <div class = "interviewanswers">
        <p>I’ve met a lot of members who have done what I have to do, what I mean is that they have taken steps before I’ve had to take them, and they’ve definitely helped me take steps of my own. For example, a lot of members have applied to internships before. Last year, I hadn’t done that before but I met a lot of people who had done that and helped me out. I’m an international student, so I’ve met Vítor, the president, who helped me out with some visa stuff with internships over the summer. I’ve gained a lot of knowledge from people who have done things that I have to do now. They know what to do better than I do, and they’re more than willing to help out.

    <div class = "interviewquestions">
        <h5>Is UPE fun?</h5>
    </div>
    
    <div class = "interviewanswers">
        <p>Yea, yea, I feel like chapters are fun. We do a lot of different activities, they’re pretty diverse. There are some cool ideas like the TedTalks (members are given the opportunity to present about any subject they want to the rest of the group), the professors that come to speak, there’s always a wide variety of activities to do and it doesn’t get repetitive at all. Yea, I think it’s fun.

    <div class = "interviewquestions">
        <h5>Who’s your favorite member? Why?</h5>
    </div>

    <div class = "interviewanswers">
        <p>Oh no, okay one second. Let me think about this one. Ok, I would go with Phillip, who I think is the marketing director right now… hes on E-board. I just think he’s hilarious. I think all my friend group agrees, he’s hilarious because he doesn’t have a filter so he just says whatever comes to his mind, in a good way. So, yea, probably my favorite member, he just makes me laugh all the time.

    <div class = "interviewquestions">
        <h5>What do you like most about UPE?</h5>
    </div>

    <div class = "interviewanswers">
        <p>100% the people. I feel like the previous experience I mentioned before just helps you so much. I haven’t had to do a lot of research just because someone has done it before me, and someone has done it before them, etc. etc. It just saves a lot of time, gives you mentors that you can always ask for help, so 100% the people, people that you can ask for help whenever.

    <div class = "interviewquestions">
        <h5>Did anything surprise you about the club?</h5>
    </div>

    <div class = "interviewanswers">
        <p>Um, yea, just how weird chapters are. Some chapters are just strange polls about, like, I dont know, waffles or french toast or some like strange things that I wasn’t expecting. But yea… 
    </p>
    <p>EDITORS NOTE: each chapter (or meeting) begins with a poll, and each member is asked for their opinion. While I've been a member, the polls have been our favorite kind of egg, whether UPE is a cult, and if we like daylight savings time. As you can tell, some pretty random stuff.</p>
    </div>

    <div class = "interviewquestions">
        <h5>Finally, is there anything you’d like to say to someone who is considering joining?</h5>
    </div>

    <div class = "interviewanswers">
        <p>If I had to encourage someone to join, I’d tell them that a lot of people are CS majors, and even if they aren’t there’s probably someone in your major that will be able to tell you what classes are good, what classes are bad, because they’ve taken them before. That saves a lot of time and wrong choices like choosing classes that are not good or have bad professors or classes that are super interesting and you never would’ve taken. 100% having people in your major helps so much. If I had to give specific advice, I’d say to stay pretty relaxed for the interview. Talk through everything you’re doing, as long as you’re telling us what you are thinking you probably will be good because we can help you out from there. And… yea they should definitely join.
